# BitmapGlyphLabel

This is a Swift package for creating SpriteKit labels using bitmap fonts generated by BMFont xml format compatible apps such as BMGlyph, BMFont and Glyph Designer 2

<h3>Usage</h3>

1. add the package to your project through Xcode or by editing your Package.swift file and adding:
`.package(url: "https://github.com/gabrielnica/bmglyph-swift.git", from: "1.0.0")`
2. import the library
`import BitmapGlyphLabel`
2. create a font object

```Swift
let font = BitmapGlyphFont(named: "myFont")
```
or

```Swift
let cachedAtlas = ...
let font = BitmapGlyphFont(named: "myFont", usingAtlas: cachedAtlas)
```

if you already loaded the atlas in memory for caching purposes. It is recommended to also store the font for future use

4. create a label node add it to your scene

```Swift
let labelNode = BitmapGlyphLabel(text: "Some text", font: font)

self.addChild(labelNode)
```

By default the text is horizontally and vertically centered, with left justification. You can change this by modifying the `.horizontalAlignment`, `.verticalAlignment` and `.justification` properties respectively. The text can also be modified after the label has been created by changing the, surprise, `.text` property of the label

The node returned by `BitmapGlyphLabel` is of type `SKNode`. To get the total size of the node without computing it through SpriteKit you can access the `.totalSize` property of the label
